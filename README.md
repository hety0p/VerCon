// VerCon

Hello moderation team! I hope you guys are doing well!!

I've been told by Jibirsh, that since he's read my request, he will just push this straight to the "logs part", so I'm not sure if I should re-write the first parts of the request, but I will be writing them again, just in case you're not Jibrish who is reading this right now.

I have also sent my X account (verified on X, conservative stances (i'll provide proof of that as well, you can see them by scrolling down)) to Jibrish, he said I should delete that message and he does not want me to doxx myself, so he wanted me to remove my personal information from the application proccess.

Now I will be listing the parts of this message and the ways through which you will be able to verify me. If you want to read;

1-) A brief summary of who I am and what type of consevative I am. (Jump to line 18)

2-) A list of Admin/Moderatots who support my VerCon proccess (with screenshots) (Jump to line 20)

3-) A collection of the screenshots of my reposts on X as well as some accounts I follow, I thought this is a good way to prove things I agree with, without doxxing my face or real life name (as Jib said) (Jump to line 36)

I'm Renko. I'm a 19 year old girl from Norway, I was born in USA therefore I'm also American. I'm studying law at UIO. I do not think any single moral/political philosopy fully describes me, but I believe a form of right-wing libertarianism combined with conservatism would be the one that describes me the most accurately. I'm currently level 15 with a voice level of 5 in the server.

// First of all, I respect people's privacy. I want to let you know before these screenshots was taken, I took permission from the people (all of them)

These are the ones that support it openly and directly. There's also Bibfin, but he said he would only support the proccess conditional on my X showing conservative stances (which it does, but still this is an indirect support, not as clear and open as others)

Since Jibrish wanted me to remove my X because it has critical personal information of me (My face, location and my actual name), I cannot share my account again, but I can still show you the posts I re-posted and some of the accounts I follow to give you an idea of what type of account it is;

Parts of my following list:

(I do not only follow right wing news sources, though. I read both sides (not in a meme way) I follow CNN as well.
