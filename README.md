Hello moderation team! I hope you guys are doing well!!

I've been told by Jibirsh, that since he's read my request, he will just push it straight to the "logs part", so I'm not sure if I should re-write the first parts of the request, I will be writing
them again, just in case you're not Jibrish who is first reading this right now. <img width="1080" height="899" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2bc0b3e-d251-487d-ac71-303b8bcbaef7" />
